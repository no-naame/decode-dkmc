# Invisible Labor Scoring System

## Overview
This module calculates and tracks "invisible labor" - the non-code contributions that maintainers make which are often overlooked.

## Team Member Workspace
This is your dedicated module. You can freely modify files in this directory without conflicts.

## Files Structure
- `routes.py` - API endpoints
- `schemas.py` - Request/response models
- `service.py` - Business logic (implement your scoring algorithm here)
- `models.py` - Database models (create if needed)
- `utils.py` - Helper functions (create if needed)

## Implementation Tasks
1. Define scoring algorithm for invisible labor
2. Integrate with GitHub API to fetch contribution data
3. Implement database models for storing scores
4. Create analytics and visualization data endpoints
5. Add caching for performance optimization

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/invisible-labor-scoring/calculate` - Calculate score
- `GET /api/v1/invisible-labor-scoring/metrics/{username}` - Get metrics
