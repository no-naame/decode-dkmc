## Overview
This module detects and monitors burnout risk indicators for open source maintainers.

## Team Member Workspace
This is your dedicated module. You can freely modify files in this directory without conflicts.

## Files Structure
- `routes.py` - API endpoints
- `schemas.py` - Request/response models
- `service.py` - Business logic (implement your risk detection here)
- `models.py` - Database models (create if needed)
- `utils.py` - Helper functions (create if needed)
- `analytics.py` - Data analysis utilities (create if needed)

## Implementation Tasks
1. Define burnout risk indicators and scoring algorithm
2. Analyze activity patterns (commit times, work hours)
3. Integrate with sentiment analysis results
4. Implement alert system for high-risk cases
5. Create historical tracking and trends
6. Build notification system (email, webhooks)
7. Generate actionable recommendations

## Burnout Indicators to Track
- Excessive working hours (late nights, weekends)
- Rapid response pressure and expectations
- Lack of breaks or time off
- Negative sentiment trends
- Decreased activity (possible disengagement)
- Increased conflict in interactions
- High workload without support
